# Razorpay Integration for YouniqueIndia

## âœ… Your Razorpay Integration Status

Your Razorpay integration is **already working correctly**! The test results show:

- âœ… **Backend Payment Handler**: Working perfectly
- âœ… **Signature Verification**: Secure and functional  
- âœ… **Order Creation**: Successfully creates Razorpay orders
- âœ… **Payment Processing**: Handles payments correctly

## About the Pinelab Payment Extensions Plugin

The plugin you found (`@pinelab/vendure-plugin-payment-extensions`) is designed for **B2B scenarios** where orders need to be settled **without upfront payment** (like credit arrangements). It's **not needed** for your Razorpay integration since Razorpay handles actual payment processing.

## What You Need Next: Frontend Integration

Since your backend is working, you need to integrate Razorpay checkout in your frontend (storefront). Here's what you need:

### 1. Frontend Razorpay Checkout

Your frontend needs to:

1. **Create a Razorpay order** using the new GraphQL mutation
2. **Initialize Razorpay checkout** with the order details
3. **Handle payment success** and send data back to Vendure

### 2. Available GraphQL Mutation

You now have a `createRazorpayOrder` mutation available:

```graphql
mutation CreateRazorpayOrder {
  createRazorpayOrder {
    id
    amount
    currency
    key
    receipt
  }
}
```

### 3. Frontend Implementation Example

See `frontend-razorpay-example.js` for a complete implementation example.

### 4. Environment Variables Needed

Make sure you have these in your `.env` file:

```env
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Testing Your Integration

### Backend Testing (Already Working)
```bash
npm run test:razorpay
```

### Frontend Testing
1. Create an order in your storefront
2. Proceed to checkout
3. Use the Razorpay integration
4. Verify payment completion

## Integration Architecture

```
Frontend Storefront
    â†“ (Create Razorpay Order)
Vendure GraphQL API
    â†“ (createRazorpayOrder mutation)
Razorpay API
    â†“ (Order created)
Frontend Checkout
    â†“ (Payment completed)
Vendure Payment Handler
    â†“ (Signature verified)
Order Completed âœ…
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. **"No active order found"**
- Ensure customer has items in cart
- Check authentication state

### 2. **Signature verification fails**
- Verify Razorpay credentials are correct
- Check frontend is sending all required fields

### 3. **Payment method not available**
- Ensure payment method is enabled in Vendure admin
- Check customer group eligibility if configured

## Next Steps

1. âœ… **Backend**: Complete (your current implementation)
2. ðŸ”„ **Frontend**: Implement Razorpay checkout in your storefront
3. ðŸ§ª **Testing**: Test with real transactions
4. ðŸš€ **Production**: Deploy with production Razorpay keys

Your Razorpay integration foundation is solid! You just need to connect it to your frontend checkout flow.
